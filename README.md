Using the Alter Table command:

a. Create primary keys (fields with the name "id") in the tables.
b. Create relationships between the tables (using "foreign keys" that should be identified).
c. Add a new field "ativo" to the "funcionario" table with a data type of true/false.

Visualize the created keys using the appropriate SQL command.

Create a new employee of your choice, whose role has id 5.

Using the appropriate SQL command, change the function id of the created record from 5 to the function with id = 4.

Update the records in the "funcionario" table, so that the "ativo" field (created earlier) is set to "true" for all records.

Using the appropriate SQL command, delete the record you created.
